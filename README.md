## Battleship

The classic game of Battleship and some extras

### Why create Battleship

As a challenge to see If I can create something. Isn't that the goal of most hobbies? To create something new! And enjoy myself along the way. 

### Getting started

You can run the game locally and play against a bot or connect to a server and play multiplayer.
Alternatively you can also run the server instance locally. Or if you are really brave, you can create a bot that plays the game for you.

#### Prerequisites

- [Java Runtime](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) >= 17
- [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)

#### Running the game

**TODO**!: The game is not yer complete

Some of what's to come:
